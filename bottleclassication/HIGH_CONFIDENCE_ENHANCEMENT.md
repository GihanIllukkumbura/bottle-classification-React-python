# Bottle Detection System - Bug Fixes and High Confidence Enhancement

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Division by Zero Error

**Problem**: When camera fails to capture frames, `frame_count` remains 0, causing division by zero error in detection rate calculation.

**Solution**: Added conditional check before division:

```python
if frame_count > 0:
    print(f"Detection rate: {(detection_count/frame_count*100):.1f}%")
else:
    print("Detection rate: No frames processed")
```

### 2. 📷 Camera Error Handling

**Problem**: Poor error messages when camera fails to initialize or capture frames.

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling with troubleshooting tips:

```python
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("❌ Error: Could not open webcam")
    print("   Troubleshooting:")
    print("   1. Check if camera is connected and not used by another app")
    print("   2. Try changing camera index (0, 1, 2, etc.)")
    print("   3. Check camera permissions")
    return
```

## New High Confidence Feature 🎯

### Feature Overview

The system now only auto-stops and displays images for **HIGH CONFIDENCE** bottle detections (>0.8 confidence score), filtering out false positives and low-quality detections.

### Key Changes

#### 1. **Dual Confidence Thresholds**

```python
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.6      # Base detection threshold
HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.8 # Auto-stop threshold
```

#### 2. **Separate Detection Tracking**

- `bottles_detected_current`: All bottles above base threshold (0.6)
- `high_confidence_bottles`: Only high confidence bottles (>0.8)
- `high_confidence_bottle_info`: Data for high confidence detections only

#### 3. **Smart Auto-Stop Logic**

- Camera only stops for HIGH confidence detections
- Low confidence detections are shown but don't trigger auto-stop
- Clear terminal messages distinguish between confidence levels

#### 4. **Visual Differentiation**

- **Green boxes with thick borders**: High confidence bottles (>0.8)
- **Orange boxes with thin borders**: Regular confidence bottles (0.6-0.8)
- **Different labels**: "HIGH: 0.85" vs "Bottle: 0.65"

#### 5. **Enhanced Display Information**

```
FPS: 25.3
High Conf Events: 1      # Number of high confidence auto-stops
All Bottles: 3           # Total bottles currently visible
High Conf Now: 1         # High confidence bottles in current frame
```

### Terminal Output Examples

#### High Confidence Detection (Auto-stops):

```
🍾 HIGH CONFIDENCE BOTTLES DETECTED! Frame #47
   High confidence count: 1 bottles
   Total bottles seen: 2 bottles
   Time: 14:23:15
   High confidence scores: ['0.87']
   Frame saved to variable (Total saved: 1)
------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 STOPPING CAMERA AND DISPLAYING HIGH CONFIDENCE BOTTLE IMAGE...
```

#### Low Confidence Detection (Continues):

```
⚠️  Only low confidence bottles detected. Auto-stop requires high confidence (>0.8)
   Highest confidence seen: 0.72
```

## Usage Instructions

### Auto-Stop Detection (Option 3)

1. Run `python object_detection_1.py`
2. Choose option 3: "Real-time detection (auto-stop on detection)"
3. Position bottle clearly in front of camera
4. Wait for HIGH confidence detection (>0.8)
5. Camera automatically stops and displays the bottle image

### Confidence Score Tips

- **Good lighting** improves confidence scores
- **Clear bottle visibility** (not partially obscured)
- **Stable positioning** (not moving quickly)
- **Proper distance** (not too close or far from camera)

## Technical Implementation

### High Confidence Filter Logic

```python
for box, label, score in zip(boxes, labels, scores):
    if label.item() == 44 and score > CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
        # Add to regular detection list
        bottle_info.append(bottle_data)

        # Check for high confidence
        if score > HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
            high_confidence_bottles += 1
            high_confidence_bottle_info.append(bottle_data)

# Only auto-stop for high confidence
if high_confidence_bottles > 0:
    # Save frame and stop camera
    break
```

### Benefits

1. **Reduces false positives**: Only stops for confident detections
2. **Better user experience**: Clear feedback about detection quality
3. **Improved accuracy**: Focuses on high-quality bottle identifications
4. **Visual feedback**: Real-time confidence visualization
5. **Robust error handling**: Better camera failure management

## Configuration

You can adjust the confidence thresholds in the code:

- `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.6`: Minimum for detection display
- `HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.8`: Minimum for auto-stop

Lower values = more sensitive but more false positives
Higher values = more selective but may miss some bottles
